For people brand new to python/coding, do the following.

  'pip install _____'. IE pip install time then pip install pyautogui then pip install random lastly, pip install math

4. To run the sniffer, navigate to the folder you downloaded the code to, and type python sniffer.py, then follow the prompts

To navigate terminal, search your computer for 'terminal'. It'll be an ugly black box. You should start out at C:/User/.
Type in dir to show you where you can move.
type in cd to change directories. 
When you type in dir, I'm assuming one of the options will be the downloads folder. Type in cd downloads.
Now you're in the downloads folder. Type in dir again to see where you can go. I'm guessing there will be a folder named ghostversion1. Type in cd ghostversion1.
now you should be in the ghost folder. type python sniffer.py to run the script.
